`royale` provides an R interface to the [Clash Royale API](https://developer.clashroyale.com/#/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `royale` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("christopherkenny/royale")
```

## Example

Current endpoints are included for cards, rankings, tournaments, players, and clans.

To get a player's data, we can use:
```{r}
library(royale)

cr_get_player('JYJQC88')
```

To get a clan, we can use:

```{r}
clan <- cr_get_clan('99R2PQVR')
clan
```
Clans are put into long form, so each player in a clan is an observation:
```{r}
clan |> 
  dplyr::relocate(dplyr::starts_with('player'), .before = dplyr::everything())
```


## RoyaleAPI Proxy

If you are using a RoyaleAPI proxy, this can be configured by setting `options(royale.use_proxy = TRUE)`.
This can be turned off by setting `options(royale.use_proxy = FALSE)`. It is off by default.
